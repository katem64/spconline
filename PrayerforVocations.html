          <p>O Jesus, Divine Shepherd of souls, who called your Apostles to become fishers of man, now call the ardent and generous hearts of our youth to make them your followers and ministers. Let them share your thirst for that universal redemption for which you daily renew your Sacrifice upon the altar.</p>

          <p>Lord Jesus, always living, intercede for us. Extend our horizons to the entire world where so many brethren make silent supplication for the light of your truth and the warmth of your love. In answer to your call, may many young men prolong here below your mission and edify your Mystical body, the Church, and become the salt of the earth and the light of the world.</p>

          <p>Extend, O Lord, your loving call to many pure and generous hearted your women, that they may grow in their desire for evangelical perfection and may dedicate themselves to the service of the Church and their neighbors who so desperately need such assistance and charity.</p>

          <center>II</center>
          <p>Enlightened and encouraged by your word, we pray you Lord: for those who have responded to your call and are now living it; for bishops, priests, deacons; for religious Brothers and Sisters - who have consecrated themselves to you; for your Missionaries; for generous lay persons engaged in ministries instituted  or recognized by the Church. Support them in their suffering, assist them in their solitude, protect them in persecution, confirm them in fidelity.</p>

          <p>We pray you Lord, for those who are beginning to open themselves to your call or who are already preparing themselves to follow it. May your word enlighten them, your example attract them, your grace guide them to sacred orders, to religious commitment, to the missions. Lord, may your word guide and support them all, so that they may know how to direct, advise and help their brethren with that force and conviction of love which you possess and which you alone can communicate.</p>

          <center>III</center>
          <p>Holy Spirit, you who are the mainspring of great thoughts and generous resolutions, bring about in the hearts of young girls the desire to consecrate themselves entirely to God. Disclose to them the beauty of religious life in its absolute self-giving. Make them hear Christ�s call and give them strength to respond.</p>

          <p>Stir up within us and our Congregation a profound interior life and an ardent apostolic zeal, that we may 
          deserve  to receive new recruits.
          our ideal and offer them a milieu of authentic holiness. Amen.
          particular, assure our Congregation of a recruitment that is sufficient and even plentiful.
          Stir up within us and our Congregation a profound interior life and an ardent apostolic zeal, that we may deserve to receive new recuits.</p>

          <p>Grant that by the intensity of a Charity adapted to the spiritual needs of our time we may draw many souls to our ideal and offer them a milieu of authentic holiness. Amen.</p>

          <center>IV</center>

          <p>Holy Virgin Mary, make the world come alive with the enthusiasm that accompanied the offering of your own life and heart to God. Develop in a great number of souls the yearning to follow the way of perfection. In particular
          assure our Congregation of a recruitment that is sufficient and even plentiful.</p>

          <p>You who are the Virgin of virgins, we pray you to gather around you a great number of virgins so that you can share with them the joy of your union with Christ. Amen.</p>

          <center>V</center>

          <p>Lord, look with love on the field you have sown in Levesville. Grant us fidelity to the Charism of our Founder.</p>

          <p>May we never forget our humble origin, the  
          Poverty of our first Sisters and their apostolic
          zeal in proclaiming the gospel.
          Through the intercession of Father Chauvet and Mother Marie Anne make us grow in number and in holiness �for the glory of God, the good of the Church and the service of our neighbor.�</p>
