          First Station:<b> Jesus is condemned to death.</b> 
          <p>Ps 22:6-7  �Here am I, now more worm than man, scorn of mankind, jest of the people, all who see me jeer at me, they toss their heads and sneer . . .�</p>

          <p>Jn. 19:14-16  �It was Passover Preparation Day, about the sixth hour. �Here is your king� said Pilate to the Jews. �Take him away, take him away!� they said. �Crucify him!� �Do you want me to crucify your king?� said Pilate. The chief priests answered, �we have no king except Caesar.� So in the end Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified.�</p>

          <p>Prayer: Lord, you are this man whom Pilate presents to us, the perfect man whom the father searched and waited for since the dawn of creation, the Son who freely gives back the his life to the Father. Jesus, teach us to abandon ourselves into the hands of the Father.</p>

          Second Station:<b> Jesus takes up His Cross.</b>

          <p>Is 53:4 �And yet our ours were the sufferings he bore, ours the sorrows he carried. But we, we thought of him ass someone punished, struck by God brought low.�</p>

          <p>Prayer:  Men laid the cross upon you, but in fact it is you who by Incarnation, bore our humanity in God. Make us perceive more and more that it is you in us who bear the cross and that without you we are nothing.</p>

          Third Station:<b> Jesus falls the first time.</b>
          <p>Ps 119:25,28  �Down in the dust I lie prostrate: revive me as your word has guaranteed. I am sleepless with grief: raise me as your word has guaranteed.�</p>

          <p>Ac 9:4-6      �He fell to the ground, and then he heard a voice saying, �Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?� �Who are you, Lord?� he asked, and the voice answered, �I am Jesus, and you are persecuting me. Get up now and go into the city�.�</p>
           
          <p>Prayer: Lord, who raised Paul from this failure, you bend under the weight of our sins to free us from them. Teach us to listen to you. </p>

          Fourth Station:<b> Jesus meets his Mother</b>
          <p>Dt. 7:9 �Know then that Yahweh your God is God indeed, the faithful God who is true to His covenant and His graciousness for a thousand generations towards those who love him and keep his commandments.�</p>

          <p>Ph 3:8  :. . . For Him I have accepted the loss of everything . . .�</p>

          <p>Prayer: Mary, the love for your Son which God has placed in you is a consuming fire to which your pure heart surrender. Raw us after you and teach us to give all for love of the Father.</p>

          Fifth Station:<b> Simon of Cyrene helps Jesus carry his Cross</b>
          <p>Is 41:6 �Men help one another, they say to each other, �Take heart!� �</p>

          <p>Gn 6:2  �You should carry each other�s troubles and fulfill the law of Christ�</p>

          <p>Prayer: Lord, you carry a heavy Cross, that of our misery, and you allow a man to help you. Teach us to encourage one another along the difficult road that leads to the Father.</p>

          Sixth Station:<b> A woman wipes the face of Jesus</b>
          <p>Is 53:3 �Without beauty, without majesty ( we saw him ) no looks to attract our eyes; a thing despised and rejected by man, a man to make people screen their faces; he was despised and we took no account of him.�</p>

          <p>Ph 6:7  �His state was divine, yet he did not cling to his equality with God but emptied himself to assume the condition of a slave and became as man are.�</p>

          <p>Prayer: As veronica knew how to be there along your way to wipe your face, teach us to extend a simple gesture that will bring comfort to a suffering brother or sister.</p>

          Seventh Station:<b> Jesus fall the second time</b>
          <p>Ps 35:15-16 �Now I have fallen, they crowd round delighted, flocking to jeer at me; strangers I never even knew with loud cries tear me to pieces, riddling me with gibe after gibe, grinding their teeth at me.�</p>

          <p>1P 2:23 �He was insulted and did not retaliate with insults; when he was tortured he made no threats but he put his trust in a righteous judge.�</p>

          <p>Prayer: In times of difficulty, when doubts and discouragement assail us, teach us, O Father, to keep alive our confidence in you.</p>

          Eight Station:<b> Jesus consoles his people.</b>
          <p>Zc 12:10-11 �. . . Over the house of David and the citizens of Jerusalem I will pour out a spirit of kindness and prayer.</p>

          <p>They will look on the one they have pierced; they will mourn for him as for an only son, and weep for him as people weep for a first-born child. When that day comes, there will be great mourning in Judah . . . �</p>

          <p>Lk 23:28  �Jesus turned to them and said, �Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, weep rather for yourself and for your children.�</p>

          <p>Prayer: Lord, you invite your people to transcend suffering and agony in order to recognize that your love alone saves us. Together with you, teach us to comfort the reality of sin which alone separates us from our Father.</p>

          Ninth Station:<b> Jesus falls the third time</b>
          <p>Mi 7:8  �Do not gloat over me, my enemy; though I have fallen, I shall rise; though I live in darkness, Yahweh is my Light.�</p>

          <p>Jm 1:12  �Happy the man who stands firm when trials come. He has proved himself, and will win the prize of life, the crown that the Lord has promised to those who love him.� </p>

          <p>Prayer:  Lord, teach us to forget each failure. May your love raises us up and make stronger and more courageous along the road that leads, through death, to life with the Father.</p>

          Tenth Station:<b> Jesus is stripped of his garments</b>
          <p>Ps 22:17-18 �I can count everyone of my bones, and there they glare at me gloating, they divide my garments among them and cast lots for my clothes.�</p>

          <p>Jn 19:23-24 �When the soldiers finished crucifying Jesus they took his clothing and divide it to four shares, one for each soldier. His undergarments were seamless, woven from one piece from neck to hem; so they divide it to four shares, one for each soldier. His undergarments were seamless, woven from one piece from neck to hem; so they said to one another, �instead of tearing it, let�s throw a dice to decide who is to have it.� �</p>

          <p>Prayer: Lord, in silence, according to the ill of 
          your Father, you allow men to strip you of everything. Teach us to focus our gaze on you alone, so that nothing will hold us back or burden us in our journey towards our goal.</p>

          Eleventh station:<b> Jesus is crucified.</b>
          <p>Gn 22:9-10  �When they arrived at the place God had pointed out to him, Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood. Then he bound his son, Isaac, and put him on the altar on top of the wood. Abraham stretched out his hand and seized the knife to kill his son.�</p>

          <p>Jn 19:18-19 �They crucified him with two others, one on either side with Jesus in the middle. Pilate wrote out a notice and had it fixed to the cross; it ran: </p>
             <p>�Jesus the Nazarene, king of the Jesus.� �</p>

          <p>Prayer:  Like Abraham who offered to you what he held most dear, we went to offer you our own will in order to be able to welcome fully your will which is that of your Father.</p>

          Twelfth station:<b> The death of Jesus</b>
          <p>Lm 2:19  �Up, cry out in the night time, in the early hours of darkness; pour your heart out like water before Yahweh. Stretch out your arms to him for the lives of your children.�</p>

          <p>Jn 19:28, 30  �After this, Jesus knew that everything had now been completed, and to fulfill the scripture perfectly, he said:   �I am thirsty� . . . After Jesus had taken the vinegar he said, �It is accomplished.� and bowing his head he gave up his spirit.�</p>

          <p>Prayer: Lord, death for you, is only a pathway to the Father. Teach us to follow you along this way.</p>

          Thirteenth Station:<b> Mary receives the body of Jesus</b>
          <p>Lm 2:13    How can I describe you, to what compare you, daughter of Jerusalem?  Who can rescue and comfort you, Virgin daughter of Zion? For huge as the sea is your affliction; who can possibly cure you?</p>

          <p>Jn 19:38  �After this, Joseph of Arimethea, who was a disciple of Jesus - though a secret one because he was afraid of the Jews - asked Pilate to let him removed the body of Jesus. Pilate gave permission, so they came and took it away.�</p>

          <p>Prayer:  O Mary, our sins are the cause of your sufferings. Teach us to love Jesus, your Son, as you yourself loved him.</p>

          Fourteenth Station:<b> Jesus is laid in the tomb.</b>
          <p>Is 53:8b-9  �Yes he was torn away from the land of the living; for our faults struck down in death. They gave him a grave with the wicked, a tomb with the rich, though he had done no wrong and there had been no perjury in his mouth.�</p>

          <p>Jn 19:40-42 �They took the body of Jesus and wrapped it with the spices in linen clothes, following the Jewish burial custom. At the place where he had been crucified there was a garden, and in this garden a new tomb in which no one had not yet been buried. Since it was the Jewish Day of Preparation and the tomb was near at the hand, they laid Jesus there.�</p>

          <p>Prayer: Lord, you loved us until death, and death on a Cross. We believe that you rose alive from the tomb on Easter morning. Grant that we be, in the world, witness to your Love.</p>
