          <p>We have been marked by the spirit of Marie Anne
          de Tilly, whose distinguishing characteristics are brought out in her last will and testament:

          <p>Superior of the girl�s school of Levesville-la-Chenard
          where, in this capacity, I am helping
          four  poor  girls  to  improve their  reading, writing and religious knowledge
          in order to become good teachers.
          I do not wish  to  be  surprised by death, the hour of which is unknown; 
          seeing that my strength is dwindling away
          due to the continued ill-treatment
          I have had to endure in word and deed for having left the world
          and given myself to God for the good of the Church and the service
          of my neighbor.</p>

          There  was  never  any  class distinction among the Sisters of the Community of  Levesville. Father de Truchis, our second Superior, emphatically notes down this distinguishing feature:

          Since  the  Rules  and  the  constant   practice  of   the
          Community from  the   beginning   admit   no  discrimi-
          nation among the sisters, we formerly expressed aver-
          sion when it was suggested  that  we  should   take  in
          girls who would occupy a rank  inferior  to  the  others.
          We  now  reaffirm  our  stand  on  this  point.  It  would 
          indeed be very strange that girls  who,  by  their  state,
          are the servants of the poor, should take in other  girls
          to be  in  a  lower  position  than  they,  for  this  would
          cause them to consider these girls as servants and  to 
          look upon themselves as ladies of rank�.

          These religious destined to live in the world are reminded by the first Rule that:

          They are by no means dispensed from the virtues
          practiced in the monasteries;

          on  the  contrary,  they  are  bound  to practice them
          even more faithfully
          than religious of the most austere orders,
          because they are exposed to greater dangers�.

          The Virgin Mary was to be their  model, and Paul the Apostle, their patron:

          They have taken Mary
          for their principal intercessors with him.
          This will give them a renewed incentive
          to work earnestly to acquire these virtues,
          seeing that she practiced them to the most eminent degree.
          They will also have a special devotion to the Apostle St. Paul.
          They will consider him their patron,
          for not only did he imitate
          Our   Lord   perfectly  in  his  poverty,  humility,  and  sufferings,
          but he also set  them  an example which they wish to follow,
          so that they may zealously engage in teaching
          and earn a living from the work of their own hands�.

          When they began to spread abroad, it is with the purpose of
          going to those place where they are wanted�
          to form little communities of two or three, 
          putting up at the village school or the hospice,
          13

          at the service of the people,
          their primary activity being
          to educate young girls,
          to visit and care for the poor and the sick.

          Their sole property was the house that Msgr. Paul Godet des Marais gave them later  on in Chartres and which became their house of formation.

          It is not enough  to  recall  the  beginning  if  we  are to give a full account of a Congregation that  has a  history of  three  centuries.

          It would be necessary to re-discover  the spirit  of daring that animated the Community which enthusiastically agreed to send four of its sisters to Cayenne in 1727:

          The Count of Maurepas,Secretary of State, asked the
          Bishop of Chartres for sisters to tend the sick in the 
          hospital of Cayenne and to instruct the children of
          that town. Thereupon, for were chosen from among
          the great number of sisters who offered to go.

          It would  be  necessary  to  recount  the series  of  heroic  deeds  lived  out  in  Guiana  and  the  Antilles by our predecessors who adapted themselves so readily  to the  circumstances  of  life,  whether this meant living among the deportees or  dying  a  premature death from endemic fever  contracted when caring for the sick.
          It would be necessary to know more about the remarkable   women   who  have oriented the destiny of the Congregation: Mother Maria, in the role of Superior or General; Mother Benjamin, that extraordinary leaders in the Far East, and a great many other besides.

          It would be necessary to meditate on the hours of our Passion, to learn of how we lived through the storm of the French Revolution of 1789, how we bore the long trial of secularization in the twentieth century, and how we are represented today by our sisters actually living behind the bamboo curtain.

          All  these  past  events  are  bound  up  with  the  present. On them is based our future which is open to the light of God�s plan, so far unknown to us.
