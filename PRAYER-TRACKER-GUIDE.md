## 💡 Tips

### Building a Prayer Habit
1. **Start small** - Even one prayer per day counts
2. **Check your stats** - See your progress weekly
3. **Don't stress** - It's about connection with God, not numbers
4. **Use recent prayers** - Quick access to your favorites

### Understanding Streaks
- A "streak" means praying at least once each day
- Missing a day resets your streak to 0
- Total days never reset - they always count up
- You can turn off streaks if they feel stressful

### What Counts as "Praying"?
Simply visiting any prayer page counts! Whether you:
- Read the full prayer
- Say it aloud
- Meditate on it briefly

As long as you open a prayer page, it's tracked.

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: What if I forget to pray one day?**
A: Your total days are never lost! Only your consecutive streak resets. Or turn off streaks in Settings to remove that pressure.

**Q: Can others see my prayer history?**
A: No! Everything is stored only on your device. It's completely private between you and God.

**Q: What if I get a new phone?**
A: Each device tracks independently. Your prayer history doesn't transfer, but you start fresh on the new device.

**Q: Can I delete my history?**
A: Yes! Clear your browser data or reinstall the app to start fresh. (Note: This will delete all history permanently)

**Q: Does it use my data/battery?**
A: Very minimal! The tracker is lightweight and works offline, so no data usage after initial install.

**Q: I don't see any statistics yet?**
A: Start by visiting a few prayer pages over several days. Statistics will build up as you pray!

## 🙏 Remember

This tracker is a tool to support your prayer life, not a scorecard. God loves you whether your streak is 1 day or 365 days. Use it in whatever way brings you closer to Him!

The most important thing is not the numbers, but the conversation with God during each prayer. 💙
